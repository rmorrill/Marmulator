## Task modes

### Fixation experiment mode
Trials (typically) require fixation to start, and successful completion requires maintenance of fixation in a bounding box.
This is automatically turned on when n_rsvp is set to >1 OR when fixation_exp_mode is set to TRUE.  
Relevant task variables: 

### Forage mode
Trials are presented in a timed manner and do not require fixation for trial start, however completion of the trial requires a saccade and fixation within a bounding box.  
Relevant task variables: 

### Trial mode
